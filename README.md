### Libraries
For this project you will need 3 python libraries: JSON, Requests, and boto3.


Letâ€™s begin by installing the requests library. To do so, run the following command:
```bash
$ pip install requests
```
If you prefer to use Pipenv for managing Python packages, you can run the following:
```bash
$ pipenv install requests
```
If you are running a non Unix environment such as windows you can use chocolatey to install pip with the following command, then run the above commands.
```bash
choco install pip
```

Next we will install the AWS SDK for python known as boto3 with pip:
```bash
pip install boto3
```

### AWS Console 

First you'll need to install AWS-CLI To be able to interact with the user console. \
To do this look at the documentation found at: [AWS-CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html)

After inputting your credentialed key's you will be ready to run the program.
